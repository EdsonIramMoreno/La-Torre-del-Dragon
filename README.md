This was my final project of a 6th semester subject called Computer Graphics 2, it is a basic 3D world, where the main point was to make it as high quality as possible.

### Build Status

------------
It is a complete 3D world, with preparation for object collision, and music display.

## Tech/Framework used

------------

This was developed with C++ and DirectX for the graphic composition of the project.

------------
### Main programming topics
------------
##### Disign Patterns:
- **Singleton**: Used as a GameManager, everything related to the game passed through this class.
- **Builder**: Used for an more understendable/easy to read instance/object declaration.

##### Also used:
- **Data hiding / Data protection**: For all objects and specifically for the main player to avoid external and no validated changes of the attributes.
- **Enums**: Used for a better and easier model identification.
- **3D Math**: Used for everything related to object movement and placement.
- **2D Math**: Used for object collision and world boundaries.
